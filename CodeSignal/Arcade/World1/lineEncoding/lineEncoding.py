"""
Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.
Example

For s = "aabbbc", the output should be
solution(s) = "2a3bc".
